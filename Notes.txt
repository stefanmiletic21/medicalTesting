Basic info:
    This is a server for defining, filling and viewing of medical tests(quizes).
    There are few roles in system:
    - Admin - makes and manages employees and users of the system
    - Nurse - makes patients and schedules and assigns exams
    - Doctor - defines different medical tests, retrieves tests for his specialty and fills them during the exam
    - Researcher - can only view filled tests

    New tests are defined by uploading strictly structured excell file to the server (more on that in "Api reference.txt" and "example.xlsx")

Security:
    When user logs in, he gets token for  authorization. After that token is used as a salt for making authorization hash
    <currentTimeInUTC>|<currentTimeInUTCSaltedByTokenAndHashed>. There is a 5min allowed deviation between time in request and calculated
    current UTC time, so even if stolen hash is useless after 5 minutes.

    Assumption is that in front of the server there would be another web server that encrypts http to https and adds Access-controll headers.


Tests:
    There is a bundle of tests in integration_tests folder that are run by pytest.

    For testing purposes there is an API endpoint /testingHash that gives you back expected header that you can use. This API is only available
    if config parameter is_testing_mode is set to true and if request is comming from localhost.
